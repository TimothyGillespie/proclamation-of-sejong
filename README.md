# Proclamation of Sejong

Work in Progress.

This repository contains an incremental game thematically placed in the Joseon Dynasty around the time Hangul was invented and spread.

Hangul is supposed to be at the heart of the game's mechanic and might serve as a fun typing help, but also I wish to tell a bit of Korean history in a engaging way.

You can play the game here: https://proclamation-of-sejong.gillespie.eu/

Reading this repository further may spoiler you. Beware!
