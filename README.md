# Proclamation of Sejong

## Background Info

The name Hyeongi (현기, 賢起) is supposed to suit the naming conventions of that time and mean:

1. 賢 (Hyeon):
   • Means “wise,” “virtuous,” or “clever.”
   • Associated with moral and intellectual excellence, making it a perfect fit for someone who values knowledge and wisdom.
2. 起 (Gi):
   • Means “to rise,” “to begin,” or “to awaken.”
   • Conveys a sense of starting something new, progress, and ambition.

It has been chosen because our protagonist is someone who is rising in success and status with his mind and the learning of Hangul.
